Evaluating the Theory: (a + b)^2 Modulo (a * b) = a^2 + b^2 Modulo (a * b)

Introduction

This project explores an intriguing mathematical relationship:

(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 when modulo of (a*b) applied on both sides. 

The goal is to validate whether this equation holds true for all integer values of and  within a specified range. Here in the code I tested for the first 1/10 of a million.

Code Description

The provided Python script systematically tests the theory by iterating through a range of integers and comparing the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation modulo . The main steps of the script are:

Iterate over all pairs , where , within a defined range.

Calculate:





Compare  and :

If they are equal, log a match.

If they differ, log a mismatch and exit.

Verify the total number of iterations against the expected count to ensure the process was exhaustive.


Observations

Initial testing suggests the theory holds true for most cases.

Larger ranges or more complex configurations may be explored for further validation.
